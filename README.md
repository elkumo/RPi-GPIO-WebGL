# RPi-GPIO-WebGL
A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is configured to use two Hall effect sensors (HES) to send input data to a Unity game. The HES are connected via the RPi's GPIO and a Python script is used to detect magnetic fields. Two HES were used to provide forward and backwards movement for the player in the Unity game.
